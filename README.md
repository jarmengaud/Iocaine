Iocaine2 Tool for FFXI

Iocaine2 is an enhancement tool for the once popular MMORPG Final Fantasy 11 (FFXI).

It's been published on ffxiscripting.com since 2008, developed and maintained by myself.
One addon (Synergizer) was developed by theofel from the same site.

Due to security and data integrity concerns, I cannot (and never will) open source
everything in the appliction. There is certain information that must remain hidden.
Other than that, everything is being published.  It is my hope that someone will be
able to learn from my efforts and/or help contribute to this tool.

If you have any questions about how anything works, is used, or would like to
contribute, please let me know.



I'm going to impose some licensing terms just to cover bases:

Any person, persons, and/or company may freely use any of my software under 
the GPLv3. Meaning, if any changes are made to the designs they must remain free and open 
under the GPLv3. The designs belong to everyone, the final application belongs to you.

That being said, I would greatly appreciate it if any users would inform me of their 
intent to use of any of this code. Please email me directly at matthamptonasic@gmail.com.
